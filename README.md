- **Nginx**: Production-ready reverse proxy and static file serving.

## üöÄ Deployment

The application can be deployed using a full-stack approach on Railway or with separate frontend/backend deployments using Vercel and Railway, respectively. Docker Compose is also available for self-hosted production environments.

### Railway Full-Stack (Recommended)

Deploy the entire application to Railway directly from your GitHub repository. Railway automatically detects the Dockerfile, sets up PostgreSQL and Redis plugins, and handles environment variables.

1.  **Go to Railway Dashboard**: [https://railway.app/dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2.  **Click "New Project"** and choose "Deploy from GitHub repo".
3.  **Select your repository** and Railway will auto-deploy.
4.  **Add PostgreSQL and Redis plugins** in your Railway project to auto-configure `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL`.
5.  **Set environment variables** in the Railway dashboard, including `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.

### Vercel + Railway (Scalable)

For independent scaling, deploy the backend to Railway and the frontend to Vercel.

**Backend (Railway):**
Follow steps 1-5 from "Railway Full-Stack" for your backend service. Copy the Railway app URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.up.railway.app`) as your API base URL.

**Frontend (Vercel):**

1.  **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: [https://vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2.  **Click "New Project"** and import your GitHub repository.
3.  **Configure Build Settings**: Framework Preset: `Vite`, Build Command: `npm run build`, Output Directory: `dist`.
4.  **Set Environment Variables**: `VITE_API_URL` (your Railway backend URL) and `VITE_APP_ENV=production`.

### Docker Production

For self-hosted deployments, use `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`. Ensure you set `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, and `REDIS_URL` environment variables.

### Troubleshooting

- **Check Logs**: Review logs on Railway/Vercel dashboards for deployment issues.
- **Environment Variables**: Verify all required environment variables (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `VITE_API_URL`) are correctly set for your chosen deployment method.
- **CORS Issues**: Ensure your frontend URL is added to backend CORS settings.
- **Database**: Confirm PostgreSQL and Redis plugins are active on Railway, or that `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` are correctly configured for Docker deployments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & API Keys

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file from `env.example` for local development. For production, configure environment variables directly in your deployment platform (Railway, Vercel, or Docker).

**Required:**

```bash
# External API Keys
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key

# Database Configuration
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_database_password
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:password@postgres:5432/github_recommender

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0

# Security
SECRET_KEY=your_super_secure_unique_key_here_at_least_32_characters_long
```

**Development Environment:**

```bash
# API Configuration
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8000
API_DEBUG=true
ENVIRONMENT=development

# Frontend Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://backend:8000
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Production Environment:**

```bash
# Railway Auto-configured
DATABASE_URL=<auto-configured>
REDIS_URL=<auto-configured>

# Vercel Frontend
VITE_API_URL=<your-railway-backend-url>
VITE_APP_ENV=production
```

### Getting API Keys

1.  **GitHub Personal Access Token**: Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens), generate a new token with `repo`, `read:user`, `read:org` scopes.
2.  **Google Gemini API Key**: Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and create an API key.

**Security Notes**: Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment variables for production and rotate keys regularly.

    (Use `fix/bug-description` for bug fixes, `chore/task-description` for maintenance, etc.)

### Coding Standards

- **Follow existing code style**: We use `black` for Python and `ESLint` with `Prettier` for JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Type Hinting**: Ensure all Python functions and complex variables use type hints.
- **Docstrings**: Add clear and concise docstrings to all public functions and classes.
- **Comments**: Use comments sparingly for explaining _why_ something is done, not _what_ it does (which should be clear from the code).

### Testing

- **Write tests**: All new features and bug fixes should be accompanied by appropriate unit and integration tests.
- **Run tests**: Before submitting a pull request, ensure all tests pass:
  ```bash
  make test
  ```
- **Test coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, focusing on critical paths and edge cases.

### Pull Request Guidelines

1.  **Keep it focused**: Each pull request should address a single feature or bug fix.
2.  **Descriptive title**: Use a clear and concise title that summarizes your changes (e.g., `feat: Add dark mode toggle`).
3.  **Detailed description**: Provide a detailed description of your changes, including:
    - The problem it solves.
    - How you solved it.
    - Any relevant design decisions or trade-offs.
    - Instructions for testing (if applicable).
4.  **Link to issues**: If your pull request addresses an open issue, link to it in the description (e.g., `Closes #123`).
